<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span>, two, three, four, five.&nbsp;
There were five of them.</p>
<p>Five couriers, sitting on a bench outside the convent on the
summit of the Great St. Bernard in Switzerland, looking at the
remote heights, stained by the setting sun as if a mighty
quantity of red wine had been broached upon the mountain top, and
had not yet had time to sink into the snow.</p>
<p>This is not my simile.&nbsp; It was made for the occasion by
the stoutest courier, who was a German.&nbsp; None of the others
took any more notice of it than they took of me, sitting on
another bench on the other side of the convent door, smoking my
cigar, like them, and&mdash;also like them&mdash;looking at the
reddened snow, and at the lonely shed hard by, where the bodies
of belated travellers, dug out of it, slowly wither away, knowing
no corruption in that cold region.</p>
<p>The wine upon the mountain top soaked in as we looked; the
mountain became white; the sky, a very dark blue; the wind rose;
and the air turned piercing cold.&nbsp; The five couriers
buttoned their rough coats.&nbsp; There being no safer man to
imitate in all such proceedings than a courier, I buttoned
mine.</p>
<p>The mountain in the sunset had stopped the five couriers in a
conversation.&nbsp; It is a sublime sight, likely to stop
conversation.&nbsp; The mountain being now out of the sunset,
they resumed.&nbsp; Not that I had heard any part of their
previous discourse; for indeed, I had not then broken away from
the American gentleman, in the travellers&rsquo; parlour of the
convent, who, sitting with his face to the fire, had undertaken
to realise to me the whole progress of events which had led to
the accumulation by the Honourable Ananias Dodger of one of the
largest acquisitions of dollars ever made in our country.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; said the Swiss courier, speaking in
French, which I do not hold (as some authors appear to do) to be
such an all-sufficient excuse for a naughty word, that I have
only to write it in that language to make it innocent; &lsquo;if
you talk of ghosts&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> talk of ghosts,&rsquo; said
the German.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of what then?&rsquo; asked the Swiss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I knew of what then,&rsquo; said the German,
&lsquo;I should probably know a great deal more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a good answer, I thought, and it made me curious.&nbsp;
So, I moved my position to that corner of my bench which was
nearest to them, and leaning my back against the convent wall,
heard perfectly, without appearing to attend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thunder and lightning!&rsquo; said the German, warming,
&lsquo;when a certain man is coming to see you, unexpectedly;
and, without his own knowledge, sends some invisible messenger,
to put the idea of him into your head all day, what do you call
that?&nbsp; When you walk along a crowded street&mdash;at
Frankfort, Milan, London, Paris&mdash;and think that a passing
stranger is like your friend Heinrich, and then that another
passing stranger is like your friend Heinrich, and so begin to
have a strange foreknowledge that presently you&rsquo;ll meet
your friend Heinrich&mdash;which you do, though you believed him
at Trieste&mdash;what do you call <i>that</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not uncommon, either,&rsquo; murmured the
Swiss and the other three.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncommon!&rsquo; said the German.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s as common as cherries in the Black
Forest.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as common as maccaroni at Naples.&nbsp;
And Naples reminds me!&nbsp; When the old Marchesa Senzanima
shrieks at a card-party on the Chiaja&mdash;as I heard and saw
her, for it happened in a Bavarian family of mine, and I was
overlooking the service that evening&mdash;I say, when the old
Marchesa starts up at the card-table, white through her rouge,
and cries, &ldquo;My sister in Spain is dead!&nbsp; I felt her
cold touch on my back!&rdquo;&mdash;and when that sister
<i>is</i> dead at the moment&mdash;what do you call
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or when the blood of San Gennaro liquefies at the
request of the clergy&mdash;as all the world knows that it does
regularly once a-year, in my native city,&rsquo; said the
Neapolitan courier after a pause, with a comical look,
&lsquo;what do you call that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>That</i>!&rsquo; cried the German.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, I think I know a name for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miracle?&rsquo; said the Neapolitan, with the same sly
face.</p>
<p>The German merely smoked and laughed; and they all smoked and
laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bah!&rsquo; said the German, presently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
speak of things that really do happen.&nbsp; When I want to see
the conjurer, I pay to see a professed one, and have my
money&rsquo;s worth.&nbsp; Very strange things do happen without
ghosts.&nbsp; Ghosts!&nbsp; Giovanni Baptista, tell your story of
the English bride.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no ghost in that, but
something full as strange.&nbsp; Will any man tell me
what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As there was a silence among them, I glanced around.&nbsp; He
whom I took to be Baptista was lighting a fresh cigar.&nbsp; He
presently went on to speak.&nbsp; He was a Genoese, as I
judged.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The story of the English bride?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Basta! one ought not to call so slight a thing a
story.&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s all one.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
true.&nbsp; Observe me well, gentlemen, it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp;
That which glitters is not always gold; but what I am going to
tell, is true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He repeated this more than once.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Ten years ago, I took my credentials to an English gentleman
at Long&rsquo;s Hotel, in Bond Street, London, who was about to
travel&mdash;it might be for one year, it might be for two.&nbsp;
He approved of them; likewise of me.&nbsp; He was pleased to make
inquiry.&nbsp; The testimony that he received was
favourable.&nbsp; He engaged me by the six months, and my
entertainment was generous.</p>
<p>He was young, handsome, very happy.&nbsp; He was enamoured of
a fair young English lady, with a sufficient fortune, and they
were going to be married.&nbsp; It was the wedding-trip, in
short, that we were going to take.&nbsp; For three months&rsquo;
rest in the hot weather (it was early summer then) he had hired
an old place on the Riviera, at an easy distance from my city,
Genoa, on the road to Nice.&nbsp; Did I know that place?&nbsp;
Yes; I told him I knew it well.&nbsp; It was an old palace with
great gardens.&nbsp; It was a little bare, and it was a little
dark and gloomy, being close surrounded by trees; but it was
spacious, ancient, grand, and on the seashore.&nbsp; He said it
had been so described to him exactly, and he was well pleased
that I knew it.&nbsp; For its being a little bare of furniture,
all such places were.&nbsp; For its being a little gloomy, he had
hired it principally for the gardens, and he and my mistress
would pass the summer weather in their shade.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So all goes well, Baptista?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indubitably, signore; very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We had a travelling chariot for our journey, newly built for
us, and in all respects complete.&nbsp; All we had was complete;
we wanted for nothing.&nbsp; The marriage took place.&nbsp; They
were happy.&nbsp; I was happy, seeing all so bright, being so
well situated, going to my own city, teaching my language in the
rumble to the maid, la bella Carolina, whose heart was gay with
laughter: who was young and rosy.</p>
<p>The time flew.&nbsp; But I observed&mdash;listen to this, I
pray! (and here the courier dropped his voice)&mdash;I observed
my mistress sometimes brooding in a manner very strange; in a
frightened manner; in an unhappy manner; with a cloudy, uncertain
alarm upon her.&nbsp; I think that I began to notice this when I
was walking up hills by the carriage side, and master had gone on
in front.&nbsp; At any rate, I remember that it impressed itself
upon my mind one evening in the South of France, when she called
to me to call master back; and when he came back, and walked for
a long way, talking encouragingly and affectionately to her, with
his hand upon the open window, and hers in it.&nbsp; Now and
then, he laughed in a merry way, as if he were bantering her out
of something.&nbsp; By-and-by, she laughed, and then all went
well again.</p>
<p>It was curious.&nbsp; I asked la bella Carolina, the pretty
little one, Was mistress unwell?&mdash;No.&mdash;Out of
spirits?&mdash;No.&mdash;Fearful of bad roads, or
brigands?&mdash;No.&nbsp; And what made it more mysterious was,
the pretty little one would not look at me in giving answer, but
<i>would</i> look at the view.</p>
<p>But, one day she told me the secret.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you must know,&rsquo; said Carolina, &lsquo;I find,
from what I have overheard, that mistress is haunted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How haunted?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By a dream.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What dream?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By a dream of a face.&nbsp; For three nights before her
marriage, she saw a face in a dream&mdash;always the same face,
and only One.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A terrible face?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; The face of a dark, remarkable-looking man,
in black, with black hair and a grey moustache&mdash;a handsome
man except for a reserved and secret air.&nbsp; Not a face she
ever saw, or at all like a face she ever saw.&nbsp; Doing nothing
in the dream but looking at her fixedly, out of
darkness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does the dream come back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never.&nbsp; The recollection of it is all her
trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why does it trouble her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Carolina shook her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s question,&rsquo; said la
bella.&nbsp; &lsquo;She don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; She wonders why,
herself.&nbsp; But I heard her tell him, only last night, that if
she was to find a picture of that face in our Italian house
(which she is afraid she will) she did not know how she could
ever bear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upon my word I was fearful after this (said the Genoese
courier) of our coming to the old palazzo, lest some such
ill-starred picture should happen to be there.&nbsp; I knew there
were many there; and, as we got nearer and nearer to the place, I
wished the whole gallery in the crater of Vesuvius.&nbsp; To mend
the matter, it was a stormy dismal evening when we, at last,
approached that part of the Riviera.&nbsp; It thundered; and the
thunder of my city and its environs, rolling among the high
hills, is very loud.&nbsp; The lizards ran in and out of the
chinks in the broken stone wall of the garden, as if they were
frightened; the frogs bubbled and croaked their loudest; the
sea-wind moaned, and the wet trees dripped; and the
lightning&mdash;body of San Lorenzo, how it lightened!</p>
<p>We all know what an old palace in or near Genoa is&mdash;how
time and the sea air have blotted it&mdash;how the drapery
painted on the outer walls has peeled off in great flakes of
plaster&mdash;how the lower windows are darkened with rusty bars
of iron&mdash;how the courtyard is overgrown with grass&mdash;how
the outer buildings are dilapidated&mdash;how the whole pile
seems devoted to ruin.&nbsp; Our palazzo was one of the true
kind.&nbsp; It had been shut up close for months.&nbsp;
Months?&mdash;years!&mdash;it had an earthy smell, like a
tomb.&nbsp; The scent of the orange trees on the broad back
terrace, and of the lemons ripening on the wall, and of some
shrubs that grew around a broken fountain, had got into the house
somehow, and had never been able to get out again.&nbsp; There
was, in every room, an aged smell, grown faint with
confinement.&nbsp; It pined in all the cupboards and
drawers.&nbsp; In the little rooms of communication between great
rooms, it was stifling.&nbsp; If you turned a picture&mdash;to
come back to the pictures&mdash;there it still was, clinging to
the wall behind the frame, like a sort of bat.</p>
<p>The lattice-blinds were close shut, all over the house.&nbsp;
There were two ugly, grey old women in the house, to take care of
it; one of them with a spindle, who stood winding and mumbling in
the doorway, and who would as soon have let in the devil as the
air.&nbsp; Master, mistress, la bella Carolina, and I, went all
through the palazzo.&nbsp; I went first, though I have named
myself last, opening the windows and the lattice-blinds, and
shaking down on myself splashes of rain, and scraps of mortar,
and now and then a dozing mosquito, or a monstrous, fat, blotchy,
Genoese spider.</p>
<p>When I had let the evening light into a room, master,
mistress, and la bella Carolina, entered.&nbsp; Then, we looked
round at all the pictures, and I went forward again into another
room.&nbsp; Mistress secretly had great fear of meeting with the
likeness of that face&mdash;we all had; but there was no such
thing.&nbsp; The Madonna and Bambino, San Francisco, San
Sebastiano, Venus, Santa Caterina, Angels, Brigands, Friars,
Temples at Sunset, Battles, White Horses, Forests, Apostles,
Doges, all my old acquaintances many times
repeated?&mdash;yes.&nbsp; Dark, handsome man in black, reserved
and secret, with black hair and grey moustache, looking fixedly
at mistress out of darkness?&mdash;no.</p>
<p>At last we got through all the rooms and all the pictures, and
came out into the gardens.&nbsp; They were pretty well kept,
being rented by a gardener, and were large and shady.&nbsp; In
one place there was a rustic theatre, open to the sky; the stage
a green slope; the coulisses, three entrances upon a side,
sweet-smelling leafy screens.&nbsp; Mistress moved her bright
eyes, even there, as if she looked to see the face come in upon
the scene; but all was well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Clara,&rsquo; master said, in a low voice,
&lsquo;you see that it is nothing?&nbsp; You are
happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mistress was much encouraged.&nbsp; She soon accustomed
herself to that grim palazzo, and would sing, and play the harp,
and copy the old pictures, and stroll with master under the green
trees and vines all day.&nbsp; She was beautiful.&nbsp; He was
happy.&nbsp; He would laugh and say to me, mounting his horse for
his morning ride before the heat:</p>
<p>&lsquo;All goes well, Baptista!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, signore, thank God, very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We kept no company.&nbsp; I took la bella to the Duomo and
Annunciata, to the Caf&eacute;, to the Opera, to the village
Festa, to the Public Garden, to the Day Theatre, to the
Marionetti.&nbsp; The pretty little one was charmed with all she
saw.&nbsp; She learnt Italian&mdash;heavens! miraculously!&nbsp;
Was mistress quite forgetful of that dream? I asked Carolina
sometimes.&nbsp; Nearly, said la bella&mdash;almost.&nbsp; It was
wearing out.</p>
<p>One day master received a letter, and called me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baptista!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Signore!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A gentleman who is presented to me will dine here
to-day.&nbsp; He is called the Signor Dellombra.&nbsp; Let me
dine like a prince.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was an odd name.&nbsp; I did not know that name.&nbsp; But,
there had been many noblemen and gentlemen pursued by Austria on
political suspicions, lately, and some names had changed.&nbsp;
Perhaps this was one.&nbsp; Altro!&nbsp; Dellombra was as good a
name to me as another.</p>
<p>When the Signor Dellombra came to dinner (said the Genoese
courier in the low voice, into which he had subsided once
before), I showed him into the reception-room, the great sala of
the old palazzo.&nbsp; Master received him with cordiality, and
presented him to mistress.&nbsp; As she rose, her face changed,
she gave a cry, and fell upon the marble floor.</p>
<p>Then, I turned my head to the Signor Dellombra, and saw that
he was dressed in black, and had a reserved and secret air, and
was a dark, remarkable-looking man, with black hair and a grey
moustache.</p>
<p>Master raised mistress in his arms, and carried her to her own
room, where I sent la bella Carolina straight.&nbsp; La bella
told me afterwards that mistress was nearly terrified to death,
and that she wandered in her mind about her dream, all night.</p>
<p>Master was vexed and anxious&mdash;almost angry, and yet full
of solicitude.&nbsp; The Signor Dellombra was a courtly
gentleman, and spoke with great respect and sympathy of
mistress&rsquo;s being so ill.&nbsp; The African wind had been
blowing for some days (they had told him at his hotel of the
Maltese Cross), and he knew that it was often hurtful.&nbsp; He
hoped the beautiful lady would recover soon.&nbsp; He begged
permission to retire, and to renew his visit when he should have
the happiness of hearing that she was better.&nbsp; Master would
not allow of this, and they dined alone.</p>
<p>He withdrew early.&nbsp; Next day he called at the gate, on
horseback, to inquire for mistress.&nbsp; He did so two or three
times in that week.</p>
<p>What I observed myself, and what la bella Carolina told me,
united to explain to me that master had now set his mind on
curing mistress of her fanciful terror.&nbsp; He was all
kindness, but he was sensible and firm.&nbsp; He reasoned with
her, that to encourage such fancies was to invite melancholy, if
not madness.&nbsp; That it rested with herself to be
herself.&nbsp; That if she once resisted her strange weakness, so
successfully as to receive the Signor Dellombra as an English
lady would receive any other guest, it was for ever
conquered.&nbsp; To make an end, the signore came again, and
mistress received him without marked distress (though with
constraint and apprehension still), and the evening passed
serenely.&nbsp; Master was so delighted with this change, and so
anxious to confirm it, that the Signor Dellombra became a
constant guest.&nbsp; He was accomplished in pictures, books, and
music; and his society, in any grim palazzo, would have been
welcome.</p>
<p>I used to notice, many times, that mistress was not quite
recovered.&nbsp; She would cast down her eyes and droop her head,
before the Signor Dellombra, or would look at him with a
terrified and fascinated glance, as if his presence had some evil
influence or power upon her.&nbsp; Turning from her to him, I
used to see him in the shaded gardens, or the large half-lighted
sala, looking, as I might say, &lsquo;fixedly upon her out of
darkness.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, truly, I had not forgotten la bella
Carolina&rsquo;s words describing the face in the dream.</p>
<p>After his second visit I heard master say:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, see, my dear Clara, it&rsquo;s over!&nbsp;
Dellombra has come and gone, and your apprehension is broken like
glass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will he&mdash;will he ever come again?&rsquo; asked
mistress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Again?&nbsp; Why, surely, over and over again!&nbsp;
Are you cold?&rsquo; (she shivered).</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear&mdash;but&mdash;he terrifies me: are you sure
that he need come again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The surer for the question, Clara!&rsquo; replied
master, cheerfully.</p>
<p>But, he was very hopeful of her complete recovery now, and
grew more and more so every day.&nbsp; She was beautiful.&nbsp;
He was happy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All goes well, Baptista?&rsquo; he would say to me
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, signore, thank God; very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We were all (said the Genoese courier, constraining himself to
speak a little louder), we were all at Rome for the
Carnival.&nbsp; I had been out, all day, with a Sicilian, a
friend of mine, and a courier, who was there with an English
family.&nbsp; As I returned at night to our hotel, I met the
little Carolina, who never stirred from home alone, running
distractedly along the Corso.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Carolina!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Baptista!&nbsp; O, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake! where
is my mistress?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mistress, Carolina?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone since morning&mdash;told me, when master went out
on his day&rsquo;s journey, not to call her, for she was tired
with not resting in the night (having been in pain), and would
lie in bed until the evening; then get up refreshed.&nbsp; She is
gone!&mdash;she is gone!&nbsp; Master has come back, broken down
the door, and she is gone!&nbsp; My beautiful, my good, my
innocent mistress!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The pretty little one so cried, and raved, and tore herself
that I could not have held her, but for her swooning on my arm as
if she had been shot.&nbsp; Master came up&mdash;in manner, face,
or voice, no more the master that I knew, than I was he.&nbsp; He
took me (I laid the little one upon her bed in the hotel, and
left her with the chamber-women), in a carriage, furiously
through the darkness, across the desolate Campagna.&nbsp; When it
was day, and we stopped at a miserable post-house, all the horses
had been hired twelve hours ago, and sent away in different
directions.&nbsp; Mark me! by the Signor Dellombra, who had
passed there in a carriage, with a frightened English lady
crouching in one corner.</p>
<p>I never heard (said the Genoese courier, drawing a long
breath) that she was ever traced beyond that spot.&nbsp; All I
know is, that she vanished into infamous oblivion, with the
dreaded face beside her that she had seen in her dream.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&lsquo;What do you call <i>that</i>?&rsquo; said the German
courier, triumphantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ghosts!&nbsp; There are no
ghosts <i>there</i>!&nbsp; What do you call this, that I am going
to tell you?&nbsp; Ghosts!&nbsp; There are no ghosts
<i>here</i>!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>I</i> took an engagement once (pursued the German courier)
with an English gentleman, elderly and a bachelor, to travel
through my country, my Fatherland.&nbsp; He was a merchant who
traded with my country and knew the language, but who had never
been there since he was a boy&mdash;as I judge, some sixty years
before.</p>
<p>His name was James, and he had a twin-brother John, also a
bachelor.&nbsp; Between these brothers there was a great
affection.&nbsp; They were in business together, at
Goodman&rsquo;s Fields, but they did not live together.&nbsp; Mr.
James dwelt in Poland Street, turning out of Oxford Street,
London; Mr. John resided by Epping Forest.</p>
<p>Mr. James and I were to start for Germany in about a
week.&nbsp; The exact day depended on business.&nbsp; Mr. John
came to Poland Street (where I was staying in the house), to pass
that week with Mr. James.&nbsp; But, he said to his brother on
the second day, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel very well, James.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s not much the matter with me; but I think I am a
little gouty.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go home and put myself under the
care of my old housekeeper, who understands my ways.&nbsp; If I
get quite better, I&rsquo;ll come back and see you before you
go.&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t feel well enough to resume my visit
where I leave it off, why <i>you</i> will come and see me before
you go.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. James, of course, said he would, and
they shook hands&mdash;both hands, as they always did&mdash;and
Mr. John ordered out his old-fashioned chariot and rumbled
home.</p>
<p>It was on the second night after that&mdash;that is to say,
the fourth in the week&mdash;when I was awoke out of my sound
sleep by Mr. James coming into my bedroom in his flannel-gown,
with a lighted candle.&nbsp; He sat upon the side of my bed, and
looking at me, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wilhelm, I have reason to think I have got some strange
illness upon me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I then perceived that there was a very unusual expression in
his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wilhelm,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I am not afraid or
ashamed to tell you what I might be afraid or ashamed to tell
another man.&nbsp; You come from a sensible country, where
mysterious things are inquired into and are not settled to have
been weighed and measured&mdash;or to have been unweighable and
unmeasurable&mdash;or in either case to have been completely
disposed of, for all time&mdash;ever so many years ago.&nbsp; I
have just now seen the phantom of my brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I confess (said the German courier) that it gave me a little
tingling of the blood to hear it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just now seen,&rsquo; Mr. James repeated,
looking full at me, that I might see how collected he was,
&lsquo;the phantom of my brother John.&nbsp; I was sitting up in
bed, unable to sleep, when it came into my room, in a white
dress, and regarding me earnestly, passed up to the end of the
room, glanced at some papers on my writing-desk, turned, and,
still looking earnestly at me as it passed the bed, went out at
the door.&nbsp; Now, I am not in the least mad, and am not in the
least disposed to invest that phantom with any external existence
out of myself.&nbsp; I think it is a warning to me that I am ill;
and I think I had better be bled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I got out of bed directly (said the German courier) and began
to get on my clothes, begging him not to be alarmed, and telling
him that I would go myself to the doctor.&nbsp; I was just ready,
when we heard a loud knocking and ringing at the street
door.&nbsp; My room being an attic at the back, and Mr.
James&rsquo;s being the second-floor room in the front, we went
down to his room, and put up the window, to see what was the
matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that Mr. James?&rsquo; said a man below, falling
back to the opposite side of the way to look up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; said Mr. James, &lsquo;and you are my
brother&rsquo;s man, Robert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Sir.&nbsp; I am sorry to say, Sir, that Mr. John
is ill.&nbsp; He is very bad, Sir.&nbsp; It is even feared that
he may be lying at the point of death.&nbsp; He wants to see you,
Sir.&nbsp; I have a chaise here.&nbsp; Pray come to him.&nbsp;
Pray lose no time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. James and I looked at one another.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wilhelm,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;this is strange.&nbsp; I
wish you to come with me!&rsquo;&nbsp; I helped him to dress,
partly there and partly in the chaise; and no grass grew under
the horses&rsquo; iron shoes between Poland Street and the
Forest.</p>
<p>Now, mind! (said the German courier) I went with Mr. James
into his brother&rsquo;s room, and I saw and heard myself what
follows.</p>
<p>His brother lay upon his bed, at the upper end of a long
bed-chamber.&nbsp; His old housekeeper was there, and others were
there: I think three others were there, if not four, and they had
been with him since early in the afternoon.&nbsp; He was in
white, like the figure&mdash;necessarily so, because he had his
night-dress on.&nbsp; He looked like the figure&mdash;necessarily
so, because he looked earnestly at his brother when he saw him
come into the room.</p>
<p>But, when his brother reached the bed-side, he slowly raised
himself in bed, and looking full upon him, said these words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">James</span>, <span
class="smcap">you have seen me before</span>, <span
class="smcap">to-night</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">and you
know it</span>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so died!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I waited, when the German courier ceased, to hear something
said of this strange story.&nbsp; The silence was unbroken.&nbsp;
I looked round, and the five couriers were gone: so noiselessly
that the ghostly mountain might have absorbed them into its
eternal snows.&nbsp; By this time, I was by no means in a mood to
sit alone in that awful scene, with the chill air coming solemnly
upon me&mdash;or, if I may tell the truth, to sit alone
anywhere.&nbsp; So I went back into the convent-parlour, and,
finding the American gentleman still disposed to relate the
biography of the Honourable Ananias Dodger, heard it all out.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
